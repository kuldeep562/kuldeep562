### 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate AI/ML engineer currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. My core focus lies in applying AI to solve meaningful, real-world problems — with a strong belief in responsible and ethical innovation.

I specialize in Emotion AI, Natural Language Processing, and Human-Centered Machine Learning. From academic research to hands-on projects, I aim to bridge theory and application to craft AI that’s not just intelligent — but useful, explainable, and socially impactful.
