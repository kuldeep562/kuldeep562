### 🧠 About Me

I’m an AI/ML engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems responsibly. With a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, I specialize in **Emotion AI**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Human-Centered Machine Learning**.

Currently, I work as an **AI/ML Engineer**, bridging the gap between AI theory and practical, production-ready solutions.

### 🧪 Current Focus

- Emotion AI & speech-driven affective computing  
- Advanced LLM applications using LangChain & prompt engineering  
- MLOps pipelines for scalable, production-grade ML systems  
- Ethical AI: fairness, transparency, and responsible deployment  
- AI applications in healthcare, edtech, and other socially impactful domains  

> 💡 *Always learning. Always building. Always aiming for impact.*

### 🚀 Real-World AI Experience

Transitioned from AI theory to real-world implementation during my internship and current role:

- Handled **large-scale, messy datasets**: cleaning, normalization, annotation (24,000+ medical images)  
- Built **robust data pipelines** and optimized model inference for latency and resource efficiency  
- Integrated AI solutions with **APIs, edge devices, and UI systems**  
- Wrote **production-ready, tested code**, ensuring scalability and reliability  
- Collaborated with **cross-functional teams** to turn prototypes into usable products

### 💡 What I’ve Learned

1️⃣ **Data is Everything** – Quality datasets make or break AI solutions.  
2️⃣ **Models are engines; products are vehicles** – Building pipelines and integrations is as important as training models.  
3️⃣ **Accuracy ≠ Impact** – Latency, efficiency, and usability matter more than raw accuracy.  
4️⃣ **AI is a Team Sport** – Collaboration, documentation, and iteration turn ideas into products.  

> *Understanding models is step 1. Making them usable, scalable, and impactful is step 100.*
